    <h1>Meet the Team behind Whisker President</h1>

    <h2>This project is developed as a vertical slice for our capstone game design studio course at UCSC.</h2>

    <h3>How we designed this game to fit externally imposed constraints:
        <ul>
            <li>Accessibility</li>
                <p>Our game is suitable for people with hearing impairments since it can be played without any audio</p>
            <li>Localization</li>
                <p>We have a language select screen that supports English and Mandarin</p>
            <li>Game Format</li>
                <p>We have committed to delivering a Unity offline game in a Windows/Mac build that supports web browsers. The total download size is under 100Mib.</p>
        </ul>
